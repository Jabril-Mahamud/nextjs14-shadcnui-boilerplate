# Python Guide from Jabril

This site is a personal project I created to answer a question I get a lot:  
**“How did you learn software engineering?”**

I wanted to share the key resources and knowledge that helped me—especially for beginners.  
The content is available in **English** and **Somali**, so more people can benefit regardless of language.
